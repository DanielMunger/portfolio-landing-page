            Originally from <em>Carbondale, Colorado</em>, I now reside in <em>Portland, Oregon</em> where I am attending <strong>Epicodus.</strong> My hope is to graduate from <strong>Epicodus</strong> with a strong foundation in coding and transistion those skills to the private sector as a means of employment. Specifically, I am interested in back-end work and system design, and possibly transition into electrical or computer engineering. I would also like to work in the energy sector, focusing on clean power. Another possible sector to work in would be security.<br>   Growing up in Colorado, I was always outside, enjoying my surroundings through numerous outdoor sports. The outdoors acurately reflect who I am as a person and have shaped my expierences throughout my formative years. Skiing, kayaking, climbing, fishing, hiking, and general activity kept me entertained year-round. I've yet to explore much of the PNW but my general sense is that it is quite similar to Colorado in terms of outdoor enjoyment. I'm looking forward to some serious exploring and outdoor enjoyment...

          <li><a href="https://github.com/Solgo/Cupcake-Warehouse/tree/master/cupcake-shop" target="blank">Cupcake_Warehouse</a></li>
          <p>This webpage was created on 10/12/16. It has several pages that can be navigated through. The main objective of this project was to experiment with cascading. We found ourselves to be succesful in that exploration.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/Solgo/a-place-to-visit/blob/master/index.html" target="blank">A_Place_to_Visit</a></li>
          <p>This project was created on 10/13/16. The goal of this project was to explore the effects of bootstrap styling. We created several columns and rows and used nested tags to further style the page with our own custom stylesheet. </p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/Solgo/favorite-band/blob/master/index.html" target="blank">Kings_of_Leon</a></li>
          <p>This project was created on 10/13/16. The goal was to explore styling with targeting of specific tags. We were able to accomplish this, however, the page could be refined further.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/Solgo/decorate/blob/master/index.html" target="blank">Super_Amazing_Interior_Designs</a></li>
          <p>This project was created on 10/12/16. The main objective was to explore the box model. We added padding, margins, and borders to images and text.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/Solgo/wikipedia-rebuild/blob/master/index.html" target="blank">Wikipedia_Rebuild</a></li>
          <p>This project was created on 10/13/16. We attempted to replicate the Wikipedia home page as closely as possible. This involved bootstrap, custom styling, cascading as well as html principals. It was a difficult task and we were unable to fully replicate the page. More time and research are needed to finish this project.</p>
